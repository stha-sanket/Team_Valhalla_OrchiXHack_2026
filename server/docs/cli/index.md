# CLI Reference

EFC ships a single `efc` binary installed as a dev dependency when you use `create-efc-app`. The scaffolder (`npx create-efc-app`) is a separate one-time tool.

## Installation

The `efc` binary is automatically available after scaffolding. For a manual install:

```bash
npm install --save-dev express-file-cluster
```
