# Clustering

EFC uses Node's built-in `cluster` module to fork identical worker processes — one per CPU core by default. The OS load-balances incoming connections across them with no application-level proxy needed.

---

## How it works

```
              Master Process  (cluster.isPrimary)
         ┌────────────────────────────────────┐
         │  fork × N workers                  │
         │  respawn on 'exit'                 │
         └──┬──────────┬──────────┬───────────┘
            │          │          │
       Worker 1    Worker 2   Worker N
       Pre-Flight  Pre-Flight  Pre-Flight
       DB Connect  DB Connect  DB Connect
       Auth Config Auth Config Auth Config
       Scan Routes Scan Routes Scan Routes
       Reg. Tasks  Reg. Tasks  Reg. Tasks
       HTTP Listen HTTP Listen HTTP Listen
                 ↑
       OS round-robins connections
```

When `cluster: true` (or `NODE_ENV === 'production'` with no explicit value), `ignite()` checks `cluster.isPrimary`:

- **Primary** — calls `runMaster()`, forks workers, watches for exits, and returns `undefined`.
- **Worker** — runs the full Pre-Flight lifecycle, starts Express, and returns an `http.Server`.

---

## Pre-Flight lifecycle (per worker)

Every worker runs these steps in order before accepting any connections:

| Step | What happens |
|---|---|
| 1. Connect Database | Establishes this worker's own connection pool to MongoDB. (PostgreSQL is a selectable choice but not yet implemented in the runtime.) |
| 2. Configure Auth | Wires the JWT secret, strategy, and cookie options into the auth module. |
| 3. Scan tasks | Walks `src/tasks/` and registers every `defineTask` export in the task registry. |
| 4. Start task backend | Connects to Redis (BullMQ) and starts the queue worker with configured concurrency. |
| 5. Scan routes | Walks `src/api/` and builds the `RouteEntry[]` array. |
| 6. Mount routes | Dynamically imports each route module and registers handlers on Express. |
| 7. Listen | Starts the HTTP server and logs `[EFC] Worker <id> listening on :<port>`. |

Each worker owns its own database connection pool. There is no shared mutable state across workers.

## Configuration

```ts
ignite({
  cluster: true,          // enable/disable (default: true in production)
  workers: 4,             // defaults to os.cpus().length
  onWorkerReady: (id) => console.log(`Worker ${id} ready`),
  onWorkerCrash: (id, code) => console.error(`Worker ${id} crashed (${code})`),
});
```

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cluster` | `boolean` | `true` when `NODE_ENV === 'production'` | Fork worker processes |
| `workers` | `number` | `os.cpus().length` | Number of workers to fork |
| `onWorkerReady` | `(id: number) => void` | — | Called when a worker comes online |
| `onWorkerCrash` | `(id: number, code: number) => void` | — | Called before a crashed worker is replaced |

---

## Self-healing

If a worker process exits (crash, unhandled rejection, OOM), the master:

1. Fires `onWorkerCrash(id, exitCode)`.
2. Immediately calls `cluster.fork()` to spawn a replacement.
3. The new worker runs the full Pre-Flight lifecycle before serving traffic.

The replacement is instantaneous from the master's perspective — there is no delay or exponential backoff. If workers crash in a tight loop (bad config, missing env var), the master keeps forking. Use `efc doctor` to diagnose configuration problems before deploying.

---

## Disabling clustering

Set `cluster: false` to run a single-process server. EFC forces clustering off in development (`efc start dev`) for faster restarts and cleaner stack traces.

```ts
ignite({ cluster: false });  // single process — same as efc start dev
```

---

## Graceful shutdown

`gracefulShutdown(server)` registers `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` handlers:

```ts
import { ignite, gracefulShutdown } from 'express-file-cluster';

ignite({ cluster: true })
  .then(gracefulShutdown);
```

- On a **worker**: calls `server.closeIdleConnections()`, then `server.close()`. Forces exit after a 10-second timeout.
- On the **master** (when `ignite()` returns `undefined`): calls `shutdownMaster()` which sets a flag — the master stops forking new workers when they exit, and exits itself once all workers have drained.

Pass a custom timeout (milliseconds) as the second argument:

```ts
gracefulShutdown(server, 30_000);  // 30-second drain window
```
